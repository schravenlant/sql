# Inner join
Inner joins only return rows that have matching values
in both tables. 

And, if you inner join more than one table you will only see rows that have matching values in all tables.

Pay special attention to the explanations of `2_join_two_tables.md` and `3_join_self.md` if you want to fully understand how inner joins work.
